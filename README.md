# Twilight Imperium 4 production help

This is a tool that try to help player during the production phase of the board game Twilight Imperium 4 (which can be hell).
I created it after seeing a buddy having a real hard time to get all the rules involved in it.

This is a webapp you can access here https://ti4.ieroe.com/

It has been designed for smartphone but you can also use it on a regular computer (although it can look strange).

It is availabe in french and english (language should be detected automatically). If it does not work, please let me know.

## Usage

### Select the factions that are in play <img src="https://ti4.ieroe.com/pics/faction.svg" alt="Factions image" width="40"/>

First you have to select all the factions of all the players. This is required to insert the home systems of the factions in the empire list.

Simply click on the name of the factions. They turn blue (selected) or grey (unselected).

### Select the planets in your empire <img src="https://ti4.ieroe.com/pics/empire.svg" alt="Empire image" width="40"/>

In this tab you have to select the planets you own.

As for factions, simply click on the names. Also they turn blue (selected) or grey (unselected).

*Note : planets are ordered alphabetically and you have to manually select all planets in a system. The home systems are at the end of the list (unordered).*

### Tap cards - select options <img src="https://ti4.ieroe.com/pics/usage.svg" alt="Usage image" width="40"/>

There is a multipart tab. 

1. You can tap or untap planet card. For example if you used the planet for influence or for a tech skip.
1. At the right of the planet you have a button that indicate if you have a dock on that planet. Click on it and it will change color and indicate Dock or Nothing.
1. At the bottom you can select the Sarween tools or the Space Dock II tech if you have them (if selected they will be used in the computations as intended).

### Tap cards - select options <img src="https://ti4.ieroe.com/pics/production.svg" alt="Production image" width="40"/>

This tab is the main tab that allow you to make your production estimations.

1. Select a dock on which you want to produce.
1. Click on the - or + sign to increase the amount of units you want to produce.

You should see changes on the two bottom buttons : 
1. **Number of units** : tells you if you can produce that amount of units (according to the number of docks you have in the system and the level of your docks).
1. **Total cost** : tells you if you can pay your unit (according to the production value of your untaped cards and if you have Sarween tools).

That's it, have fun :)
